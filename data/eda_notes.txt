Selected Features by Random Forest: Index(['LotArea', 'OverallQual', 'BsmtFinSF1', 'TotalBsmtSF', '1stFlrSF', '2ndFlrSF', 'GrLivArea', 'GarageCars', 'GarageArea'], dtype='object')

removing mssubcalss actually - weaker correlation

mean for missing values of lot frontage

removing lot area and add log transfdoramtion for lotarea

Dropped Alley column due to excessive missing values.

Dropped Utilities column due to low variability.

Dropped street column due to low variability.


Lotshape - Ordinal encoding mehtod


Land Contour, LandSlope, Neigbhourhood - ordinal encoding method (decided by use the median SalePrice as a guide to determine the ranking)


but neighborhood had 25 ranks so manauiilly assigning not possible therefore method rank is used

Assigns ranks to neighborhoods based on their median SalePrice.
The lowest SalePrice gets rank 1, and the highest gets the maximum rank.



Dropped Condition1 and condition2  due to low variablity


BldgType,HouseStyle = Ordinal encoding method


Use Building Age and Time Since Remodel for better interpretability. (from year built and year remodelled features created this features and dropped these)

 

Roofstyle - ordinal encoding method

Roofmatl - Dropped column due to low variability.


combined both exerior 1st and exterior 2nd and did one hot encoding 



MasVnrType: Masonry veneer type - ordinal actually filled missing values with None

and masvnr area - may bew can drop but not now


and ExterQual: - ordinal encoding


dopped- ExterCond - due to low variability.



Foundation: Type of foundation - ordinal 




combined both BsmtFinSF1 amd BsmtFinSF2 into one 

combined 3 - BsmtQual, BsmtCond and BsmtExposure

dropped - BsmtUnfSF

no changes on TotalBsmtSF 



Heating: Type of heating Dropped column due to low variability.


HeatingQC - ordinal encoding

central air, Electrical - dropped




combined 1stFlrSF, 2ndFlrSF handled outliers using capping - Cap outliers at the 99th percentile for 1stFlrSF and 2ndFlrSF


dropped lowqualfinsf

removed outliers grlivarea



BsmtFullBath: Basement full bathrooms

BsmtHalfBath: Basement half bathrooms - removed due to very qweak correlation

FullBath: Full bathrooms above grade

HalfBath: Half baths above grade

combined othere three and removed outliers - dorpped due to total usable rooms created by adding TotRmsAbvGrd


Bedroom: Bedrooms above grade (does NOT include basement bedrooms) -dropped

Kitchen: Kitchens above grade - dropped 


KitchenQual - ordinal encoding


Fireplaces: Number of fireplaces rewmove outliers and kept as it  (may be can drop)


FireplaceQu: Fireplace quality - ordinal encoding


GarageType, GarageYrBlt - dorpped


and GarageFinish - ordinal encoding


garage cars, garage area - reomved outliers thats all



GarageQual, GarageCond, PavedDrive- low variablitiy



WoodDeckSF, OpenPorchSF - combined to form one feature - totalOutdoorSF


poolqc, fernce, MiscFeature - dorpped due to so many missing valuies


Miscvalue, MOSold, YrSold - very weak correalation


SaleCondition, SaleType - due to low variablity


LotConfig - weak correlation
